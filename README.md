To get started with the Eco-Routes project, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. This means creating a copy of the project on your system to work with.

Steps to Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt. This is where you'll type the commands.

Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eco_routes.git
Explanation:

git clone is a command that makes a copy of the repository.

Replace your-username with your GitHub username to reference the correct repository.

This command will create a new folder named eco_routes on your local machine, which contains all the files and code from the GitHub repository.

Navigate into the project directory by running the following command:

bash
Copy
cd eco_routes
Explanation:

cd eco_routes changes your working directory to the project folder (eco_routes), so you're ready to work with the project files.
